                When using any CSS Preprocessor, you will be able to program in normal CSS just as you would if the preprocessor were not in place. The good thing is you also have more options available to you. Some, such as SASS, has specific style standards which are
                meant make the writing of the document even easier, such as the freedom to omit braces if you want. Of course, CSS Preprocessors also offer other features as well. Many of the features offered are incredibly similar across preprocessors,
                with only slight variances in syntax. Thus, you can choose pretty much any one you wish, and you will be able to achieve the same things. Some of the more useful features are:
            </p>
        </main>
        <aside class="grid__sidebar">
            <h2>More info</h2>
            <p>
                CSS Preprocessors compile the code which is written using a special compiler. They then use that to create a CSS file, which can then be referenced by the main HTML document.
